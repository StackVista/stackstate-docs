# Run state

## Overview

Some components in StackState will report a **Run state**. This is different to the health state, it indicates the component’s operational state, such as running, starting, stopping or stopped. For example, StackState will currently report run states for components on AWS EC2 instances, which might result in a run state of “VM is running”.

A health check on a component can return a health state and/or a run state.
