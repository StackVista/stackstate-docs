# Configure the view health

## Overview

Reacting to each event in an environment can cause a lot of noise. This may be both undesirable and unnecessary. For example, if one or multiple components have an impact on a service, it can be sufficient to report on changes to the problem itself and not each related state change.

StackState can reduce this noise by looking at the overall health state of a **view** rather than that of individual elements. The view health state is determined by the combined health of its elements. When a view changes its health state, a view state change event is triggered and that can in turn trigger an event notification or automated action.

## Configure view health state

View health state is calculated by a **view state configuration function**. To configure a view to report its health state:

1. In the StackState UI, click **Views** from the main menu.
2. Click on the pencil icon next to a view name to edit the view.
3. Set **View Health State Enabled** to **On**.
4. Select a **Configuration function** to use to calculate the view health.
5. Provide any required arguments. These will vary according to the view health state configuration function selected. For example, for the default [MINIMUM HEALTH STATES](configure-view-health.md#minimum-health-states) configuration function:
   * **minCriticalHealthStates** - Set to at least **1**. This is the number of CRITICAL \(red\) health states required for the view to report a CRITICAL health state.
   * **minDeviatingHealthStates** - Set to at least **1**. This is the number of DEVIATING \(orange\) health states required for the view to report a DEVIATING health state.
6. Click **UPDATE** to save the new configuration to the view.
   * The view health will update immediately.

## React to view state changes

When the View health state changes, a `ViewHealthStateChangedEvent` is generated. This event can be used to trigger an [event notification](../metrics-and-events/event-notifications.md), such as an e-mail or Slack message.

## View health state configuration functions

### MINIMUM HEALTH STATES

{% hint style="warning" %}
**minCriticalHealthStates** and **minDeviatingHealthStates** must be set to **1** or higher.

When set to 0, the view will always report a CRITICAL or DEVIATING health state.
{% endhint %}

The **MINIMUM HEALTH STATES** view health state configuration function calculates the health state of the view as follows:

* The view has a `CRITICAL` health state when more than the **minCriticalHealthStates** components inside the view have a `CRITICAL` health state. This does not count propagated health states.
* The view has a `DEVIATING` health state When more than the **minDeviatingHealthStates** components inside the view have a `DEVIATING` health state. This does not count propagated health states.
* In all other situations, the view has a `CLEAR` health state.

Use the **MINIMUM HEALTH STATES** view health state configuration as a starting point to create a custom view health state configuration function.
