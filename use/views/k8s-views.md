## Overview

StackState for Kubernetes Troubleshooting has deep knowledge of Kubernetes and its components.

This includes the Kubernetes resources that make up your application, such as deployments, pods, services, and ingress. It will also automatically detect and visualize the topology of your Kubernetes infrastructure that makes up your cluster, such as nodes, namespaces, and persistent volumes.
