## Overview

StackState for Kubernetes Troubleshooting has deep knowledge of Kubernetes and its components. After installation of the StackState agent in your cluster, StackState for Kubernetes troubleshooting will automatically gather data on your Kubernetes cluster, its infrastructure and applications. It will then automatically detect and visualize the topology of your Kubernetes applications. This includes the Kubernetes resources that make up your application, such as deployments, pods, services, and ingress. It will also automatically detect and visualize the topology of your Kubernetes infrastructure, such as nodes, namespaces, and persistent volumes.
