# View structure

## Overview

A view in StackState allows you to monitor and inspect a subset of your IT environment, thus the structure of a view should allow you to filter and visualize the data in that subset in an efficient way:

* [Filters](k8s-filters.md) - Filter the components, events and traces in your view
* [Perspectives](k8s-perspectives.md) - Visualize the data in your view through different lenses
