## Overview

A view in StackState allows you to monitor and inspect a subset of your IT environment. The structure of a view is tailored towards filtering and visualizing the data in that subset (view) in an efficient way:

* [Filters](k8s-filters.md) - Filter the components (topology), events and traces in your view
* [Perspectives](k8s-perspectives.md) - Visualize the data in your view through different lenses
