# Perspectives

## Overview

The **Perspectives** of a view are displayed as tabs on the top left corner of the view UI and allow you to visualize all the data in a view through different lenses:

* [Overview or Highlights perspective](k8s-perspectives#overview-of-highlights-perspective) - depending on the type of view
* [Topology perspective](k8s-perspectives#topology-perspective) - the dependency map of the view components
* [Events perspective](k8s-perspectives#events-perspective) - all the events happening on the topology
* [Metrics perspective](k8s-perspectives#metrics-perspective) - key metrics for the most relevant components
* [Traces perspective](k8s-perspectives#traces-perspective) - the tracing information running on the topology

{% hint style="info" %}
All the **perspectives** will update their content based on the view _filters_ and _timeline_ configuration.
{% endhint %}
