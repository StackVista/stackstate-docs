# Problem notifications

## Overview

Problems in StackState generate events that can be used to trigger event notifications. StackState v4.5 does not include StackPacks that support notifications for problem events out of the box, however, the functionality to do this is available.

{% hint style="success" "self-hosted info" %}

Send notifications for the events generated by problems in your landscape using [custom event handler functions](../../develop/developer-guides/custom-functions/event-handler-functions.md).
{% endhint %}
