**This page describes StackState version 4.4.**

Go to the [documentation for the latest StackState release](https://docs.stackstate.com/use/problem-analysis/problem_notifications).
{% endhint %}

## Overview

Problems in StackState generate events that can be used to trigger event notifications. StackState v4.4 does not include StackPacks that support notifications for problem events out of the box, however, the functionality to do this is available. If you want to send notifications for the events generated by problems in your landscape, you can [create your own custom event handler function](../../develop/developer-guides/custom-functions/event-handler-functions.md).
