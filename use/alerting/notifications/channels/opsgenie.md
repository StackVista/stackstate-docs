## Configure Opsgenie notifications

To send notifications to Slack follow these steps:

1. [Create an integration in OpsGenie](#create-integration)
2. [Create the channel](#create-and-test-the-channel)

### Create integration

In order to integrate Rancher Observability with OpsGenie, a global "API key" needs to be
created.  The responders for a notification can be different for each
notification and will be configured in Rancher Observability.

In Opsgenie, go to "Settings -> Integrations".  
* Click the "Add integration" button
* Search for the "API" integration type.
* Choose a name for this integration, but *do not select an Assignee team*.

When the integration has been created, it will have an "API key".

### Create and test the channel

Select the appropriate region for your OpsGenie account and enter the "API
key".  Choose responders for the notification; *users*, *teams*, *schedules*
and *escalations* are available for this.

Click the "Add channel" button. This adds the channel to the list of channels
on the right. It will show a "Test" button. Pressing it will generate a test
alert in OpsGenie.

## OpsGenie alerts for notifications

When a notification is opened a new OpsGenie alert is created. This message
will be updated for changes, usually only when the health state changes. When
the notification is closed the OpsGenie alert is closed again.  A note on
the alert contains the reason for closing it.
