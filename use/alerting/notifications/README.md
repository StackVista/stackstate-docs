# Notifications

Notifications are the way to send alerts to incident management tools (like PagerDuty or Opsgenie), ticketing systems (like Jira, ServiceNow) or other collaboration platforms (like Slack). Notifications are triggered by health state changes of monitors on StackState components. Via the configured notification channels the health, component and monitor information is sent to external systems.
