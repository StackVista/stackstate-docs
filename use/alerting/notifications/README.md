# Notifications

Notifications in StackState are the way to send alerts to third-party applications, for example incident management tools (like PagerDuty or Opsgenie), ticketing systems (like Jira, ServiceNow), or other collaboration platforms (like Slack).

Notifications are triggered by health state changes of monitors on StackState components. Via the configured notification channels the health, component and monitor information is sent to these external systems.
