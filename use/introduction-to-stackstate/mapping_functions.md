**This page describes StackState version 4.1. **

The StackState 4.1 version range is End of Life (EOL) and no longer supported. We encourage customers still running the 4.1 version range to upgrade to a more recent release.

Mapping Function is defined by a groovy script and input parameters that groovy script requires. The goal of Mapping Function is to process topology data of the external system and prepare parameters for the template function.

![Mapping function](../../.gitbook/assets/mapping_function.png)

There are two specific Mapping Function parameters:

* ExtTopoComponent/ExtTopoRelation - these are the required system parameters. Every Mapping Function must define one of these. They are used internally by StackState and cannot be changed using API. They indicate the type of element component or relation the Mapping Function supports.
* TemplateLambda - this is an optional parameter that specifies which template functions must be used with the Mapping Function.

An example of a simple Mapping Function:

```text
def params = [
    'name': element.getExternalId(),
    'description': element.getData().getString("description").get()
];

context.runTemplate(template, params)
```
