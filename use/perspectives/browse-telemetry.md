**This page describes StackState version 4.3.**

The StackState 4.3 version range is End of Life (EOL) and no longer supported. We encourage customers still running the 4.3 version range to upgrade to a more recent release.

Go to the [documentation for the latest StackState release](https://docs.stackstate.com/).
{% endhint %}

## Overview

The StackState UI displays a visualization of filtered data for each configured telemetry stream.

Telemetry streams are added to elements automatically when they are imported to StackState or you can manually [add a single telemetry stream](../health-state-and-event-notifications/add-telemetry-to-element.md) to a single component.

## Telemetry Browser

Click on any of the telemetry stream charts, or select **Inspect stream** from its context menu, to open the telemetry browser.

Within the telemetry browser you can adjust the filters, time window and aggregation applied to the data source.
