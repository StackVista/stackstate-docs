# About checks and monitors

## Overview

StackState reports a health state for elements in the topology based on the health state reported by checks and monitors attached to the element. Checks and monitors have a similar function in StackState, but work very differently under the hood.

## Checks

### What are StackState checks?

**Checks** are a feature of StackState that provides health state information bound to the topology elements. StackState calculates the health state of a check based on the telemetry and log streams attached to an element and a set of customizable validation rules expressed in the form of **Check Functions**. It also possible to use anomaly events generated by the Autonomous Anomaly Detector \(AAD\) for anomaly health checks.

Unlike monitors, checks are defined on a per-topology element basis and rely on the telemetry streams present on the topology element to which they are attached. In this sense, each instance of a check is directly connected to the specific topology element for which it will produce health state information. This means that multiple instances of checks need to be created to serve the whole topology - one for each topology element that is to be covered by monitoring.

### Check results

Check results are displayed in the StackState UI right panel **Selection details** tab under **Health** when information about a topology element is displayed:

![Check result panel](../../.gitbook/assets/v50_check_result.png)

Each check result displays among other information:

- A **health state** produced by this check, along with the time it was updated
- A **metric chart** of the data that resulted in this health state being generated
- The check function configuration utilized by this check

The context menu of each check result (...) contains several useful shortcuts:

- **Edit** - change the configuration of a specific check.
- **Delete** - remove the Check associated with this result panel.

Note that both of the options above are disabled when in time-travelling mode - topology elements cannot be modified in the past.

## Monitors

### What are StackState monitors?

**Monitors** are a new feature of StackState, introduced in version 5.0. Monitors allow novel ways of combining 4T data and complex validation rules to improve rule expressiveness and monitoring coverage. Health state information is computed using 4T data collected by StackState and attached to topology elements using health synchronization.

Unlike checks, monitors do not directly relate to elements in the topology and do not require any changes to the topology synchronization templates in order to operate. In this sense, each monitor can be used by any number of topology elements to calculate health state information. This means that only a single instance of a monitor needs to be created to serve the whole topology.

Monitors are a flexible way to define a custom set of monitoring rules. They can be created manually, packaged as part of a StackPack, or integrated into any modern software development practice that leverages automation (for instance, GitOps).

Monitors can be managed independently to topology elements via a dedicated set of CLI commands.

### Monitor results

Monitor results are displayed in the StackState UI right panel **Selection details** tab under **Health** when information about a topology element is displayed:

![Monitor result panel](../../.gitbook/assets/v50_monitor_result.png)

The result panel displays among other information:

- A **health state** produced by the associated monitor, along with the time it has been updated,
- **Optional metric charts** of the data that resulted in this health state being generated,
- The name of the monitor associated with this result.

The context menu of each monitor result (...) allows for inspecting of the monitor definition:

- **Show monitor definition** - opens a modal window containing the full monitor definition associated with this result.
