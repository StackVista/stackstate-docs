# Events

## Overview

StackState defines an event as a timestamped record of an activity or change that an observer of the platform should be aware of. Events help you make sense of changes that impact your IT landscape and are a great asset when troubleshooting problems.

## Event source

StackState works with three different kinds of events, note that not all of these are available in the Events Perspective:

* **Internally generated events** - Events generated by StackState. The following event types will be listed in the Events Perspective: Anomaly, Component/relation created, Component/relation deleted, Component/relation updated, Health state changed, Version changed.

* **Events from telemetry streams** - Event data can be received in a log [telemetry stream](/use/metrics-and-events/telemetry_streams.md). Events from these streams will not be listed in the Events Perspective, however, they can be monitored by a check. Checks can trigger a health state change event, which would then be listed in the Events Perspective as an internally generated event.

* **Events from external sources** - Some StackState integrations can retrieve events from external systems. All events retrieved from external systems will be listed in the Events Perspective.

You can also use the StackState CLI or an HTTP POST to [send events to StackState](/configure/telemetry/send_telemetry.md#events).
{% endhint %}

## Event category

All events in StackState have a category assigned based on the event type and source system. The available categories are **Activities**, **Alerts**, **Anomalies**, **Changes** and **Others**. Events received from external systems will have a category attached to them when they arrive in StackState. If no valid category is included in an event, it will be grouped under the category **Others**.

## Event properties

Select an event to display detailed information about it in the right panel **View summary** tab. Events from external systems will also include links through to relevant information in the source system here:

* **Elements** - The components and/or relations involved in the event.
* **Event type** - A description of the event type.
* **Event time** - The time at which the event occurred. For events from an external system, this will be the timestamp from the external system. Click the timestamp to [time travel](/use/stackstate-ui/perspectives/events_perspective.md#time-travel) to the topology at the moment that the event occurred.
* **Processed time** - For external events, this is the time that the event was received by StackState. For internally generated events that affect the graph database, this is the time data was stored in the graph database. Click the timestamp to [time travel](/use/stackstate-ui/perspectives/events_perspective.md#time-travel) to the topology at the moment that the event was processed by StackState.
* **Links** - Direct links to an external source of an event. For example, a ServiceNow change request or JIRA ticket.
* **Description** - Additional information about the event. For example, the context of the event or its importance.
* **SHOW ALL PROPERTIES** - Click to access all data included in the event.
