Open telemetry provides [SDKs for many languages](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/languages/) to (auto-)instrument your application. Instrumentation enables your application to send traces, metrics and logs to Rancher Observability. Auto-instrumentation captures traces, metrics and logs for popular libraries and frameworks without any further manual intervention except including the SDK in your application.

Open Telemetry has many more SDKs than are documented here. If your language is not documented here you can use the documentation at [opentelemetry.io](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/languages/) in combination with the [SDK exporter configuration](./sdk-exporter-config.md) needed for Rancher Observability.
