# Open Telemetry Instrumentation

Open telemetry provides [SDKs for many languages](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/languages/) to (auto-)instrument your application. Instrumentation enables your application to send traces, metrics and logs to StackState. Auto-instrumentation captures traces, metrics and logs for popular libraries and frameworks without any further manual intervention except including the SDK in your application.
