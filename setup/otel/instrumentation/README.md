# Open Telemetry Instrumentation

Open telemetry provides [SDKs for many languages](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/languages/) to (auto-)instrument your application. Instrumentation enables your application to send traces, metrics and logs to StackState. Auto-instrumentation captures traces, metrics and logs for popular libraries and frameworks without any further manual intervention except including the SDK in your application.

Open Telemetry has a lot more SDKs than documented here. Please refer to [opentelemetry.io](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/languages/) for the full documentation.
