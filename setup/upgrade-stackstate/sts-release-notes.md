{% endhint %}

## StackState v4.4.x

### v4.4.0

**Features**

- Integrate network monitoring information from [SolarWinds](/stackpacks/integrations/solarwinds.md). STAC-13360
- Signficantly [improved Topology navigation](/use/stackstate-ui/perspectives/topology-perspective.md): 
  - Improved component popover with direct links to contextual actions. STAC-12909
  - Double clicking on a topology element (group, component or relation) "zooms into" that element in the Topology Perspective
  - Use the Plus button to expand a view with connected components, link from a trace span to the service. STAC-13359
- Improved propagation functions to reduce noise. Alpha release. Not enabled by default. STAC-13107
- Simplified installation and configuration of [AWS integration](/stackpacks/integrations/aws/aws.md) including coverage of Step Functions and VPC FlowLog. STAC-12395
- Support fast and low-overhead direct [synchronization of health states from external (monitoring) tools](/configure/health/health-synchronization.md). STAC-11290

**Improvements**

- The API-Integration StackPack has been removed. STAC-13346
- [Support BCrypt](/configure/security/authentication/file.md) next to md5 for file based passwords. STAC-13246
- Configuration of authorization for various StackState APIs can now be [defined in one central location](/setup/upgrade-stackstate/version-specific-upgrade-instructions.md#upgrade-to-v-4-4-x). STAC-12968
- Completed removal of deprecated baseline functions. Baseline functions should be removed from all templates. [See upgrade documentation for more details](/setup/upgrade-stackstate/version-specific-upgrade-instructions.md#upgrade-to-v-4-4-x). STAC-12602
- The HDFS OpenShift SecurityContextConfiguration is not necessary and has been removed from the documentation. STAC-12573
- [Timeline improvements](/use/stackstate-ui/timeline-time-travel.md):
  - It is now possible to zoom out of a time range. STAC-12533
  - Added support for navigating to the next and previous time range. STAC-12531
- Indirect relations for "Show root cause only" are now always shown when there is at least one invisible dependency that leads to the root cause. In previous versions of StackState an indirect relation for a root cause was only shown if there was no visible path to the root cause. STAC-11621
- [Relations to component groups are shown as solid lines](/use/stackstate-ui/perspectives/topology-perspective.md#direct-and-indirect-relations). In StackState 4.3 a grouped relation was displayed as a dashed line when the group of relations was not complete in the sense that each component in the group received that relation (this is also called surjective). STAC-11621
- Improve how component names are displayed in the Topology Perspective. STAC-13063
- The component finder modal can now be invoked using the [keyboard shortcut](/use/stackstate-ui/keyboard-shortcuts.md) `CTRL`+`SHIFT`+`F`. STAC-12957

**Bug fixes**

- Fixed issue that caused an import via the CLI to fail. STAC-13481

- Fixed issue that prevented certain views from opening from the View Overview page. STAC-13244
- Fixed crash when accessing the logs API. STAC-13149
- Backup PVC is created on installation of StackState chart to prevent Helm hanging. STAC-12696

* Performance enhancements for views

**Bug fixes**

* This release deprecates the `withCauseOf` stql construct. STAC-7884.
* The groovy sandboxing has been improved to cover a number of edge cases.
* The groovy sandbox is stricter and favors security at the cost of flexibility

  All accessible classes and packages are listed in the `<stackstate dir>/etc/sandbox.conf`. STAC-5032
