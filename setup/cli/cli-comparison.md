# Comparison between the old and new StackState CLIs

StackState has a new CLI! The new CLI has many advantages and a few notable differences. 

{% hint style="info" %}
The old CLI has been renamed to `stac`. In a future release of StackState, the new CLI will fully replace the `stac` CLI. Most commands will be ported to the new CLI, but some will be deprecated. See [CLI commands](#cli-commands) for an up-to-date overview of the port process.
{% endhint %}

## Advantages of the new CLI

The new StackState CLI has been built for a reason. Here are the major advantages of switching:

 * Easy installation and configuration for all Operating Systems
 * Native MacOS support
 * Faster releases - the CLI is versioned independently of the StackState product
 * Backwards as well as forwards compatible with StackState versions
 * Machine readable output for every command
 * Many UX improvements, including syntax highlighting, auto-completion and progress bars.
 * SaaS support

## Notable Differences

 * Unlike `stac`, the new CLI will not have commands for sending data to StackState. For these purposes, you can use either the StackState Agent or the StackState Receiver API. 
 * Some commands have been renamed to fall more in line with how we think of StackState today. For example, the old command `stac graph` is now called `sts settings`.
 * The new CLI only works with StackState v5.0 or later.

Note that this CLI was previously named `sts`. It has been renamed to `stac` with the release of StackState v5.0.

## CLI commands

The new CLI will completely replace the old `stac` CLI. Not all commands have been moved to the new CLI yet and some commands are not available in the old CLI. The following is an overview of the commands available in each CLI and the current `port` status.
