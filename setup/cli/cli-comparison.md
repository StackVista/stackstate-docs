# Comparison between the old and new StackState CLIs

## Overview

StackState has a new CLI! The new CLI has many advantages and a few notable differences. 

{% hint style="info" %}
**The old `sts` CLI has been renamed to `stac`.** 

In a future release of StackState, the new `sts` CLI will fully replace the `stac` CLI. Most commands will be ported to the new `sts` CLI, but some will be deprecated. See the [CLI command overview](#cli-command-overview) for up-to-date information on the port process.
{% endhint %}

## Why a new CLI?

The new `sts` CLI has been built for a reason. Here are the major advantages of switching:

 * Easy installation and configuration for all Operating Systems
 * Native macOS support
 * Faster releases - the CLI is versioned independently of the StackState product
 * Backwards as well as forwards compatible with StackState versions
 * Machine readable output for every command
 * Many UX improvements, including syntax highlighting, auto-completion and progress bars.
 * SaaS support

## Notable Differences between the CLIs

 * Unlike `stac`, the new `sts` CLI will not have commands for sending data to StackState. For these purposes, you can use either the StackState Agent or the StackState Receiver API. 
 * Some commands have been renamed to fall more in line with how we think of StackState today. For example, the old command `stac graph` is now called `sts settings`.
 * The new `sts` CLI only works with StackState v5.0 or later.

The `sts` CLI is:

* üéâ The new CLI!
* Works with StackState v5.0 or later. 
* Contains all of the latest commands - see the [CLI command overview](#cli-command-overview).

‚û°Ô∏è [Install the new `sts` CLI](cli-sts.md)
{% endtab %}
{% tab title="CLI: stac" %}

The `stac` CLI is:

* The old CLI. 
* Works with all supported versions of StackState
* ‚ö†Ô∏è Does not include the newest commands - see the [CLI command overview](#cli-command-overview). 
* ‚ö†Ô∏è Will be deprecated in a future release of StackState.

{% hint style="info" %}
Note that this CLI was previously named `sts`. It has been renamed to `stac` with the release of StackState v5.0.

**Not running the `stac` CLI yet?**

‚û°Ô∏è [Upgrade the old `sts` CLI to `stac`](/setup/cli/cli-stac.md#upgrade)

{% endtabs %}

## Which version of the CLI am I running?

There are now two versions of the StackState CLI and the old version of the CLI has been renamed: 

* The new CLI is called `sts` - note that this name was used by the old CLI in previous releases of StackState. 
* The old CLI has been renamed to `stac`, this allows you to have the old CLI and new CLI installed on the same machine.

You can check which version of the `sts` CLI you are running with the following command:

```commandline
sts version

# new `sts` CLI - example output:
VERSION | BUILD DATE           | COMMIT                                   
1.0.0   | 2022-06-24T12:26:50Z | 6553352125d31a46c4790068e36c8eca32ace7fd


# old `sts` CLI - example output:
usage: cli.py [-h] [-v] [-i [INSTANCE]] [-c [CLIENT]]


# no `sts` CLI installed - example output:
command not found: sts


```

If you are not running the new `sts` CLI yet, we recommend that you:

1. [Upgrade the old `sts` CLI to `stac`](cli-stac.md).
2. [Install the new `sts` CLI](cli-sts.md) 

## CLI command overview
