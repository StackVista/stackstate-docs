### New Features & Enhancements:

* Introduces a new command-line accessible [configuration backup mechanism](../data-management/backup_restore/configuration_backup.md) for just the configuration of SUSE Observability. This replaces the previous export/import backup method, improving reliability of the restoration process. Note that the import and export api's still exist but should not be used for configuration backups.
