# v1.11.3 - 15/08/2024

## Release Notes StackState version 6.0.0-snapshot.20240815083601-master-bd8cfc5 Helm Chart version 1.11.3

### New Features & Enhancements:

### Bug Fixes:

* <b>Backup:</b> Fix for exporting settings when Teams Notification Enabled.
* <b>Backup:</b> Fix StackGraph and Configuration backup jobs failing due to missing AWS ClI tool.

### Security Updates:

### Breaking Changes:
- Helm values `backup.configuration.scheduled.backupRetentionTimeDelta` and `backup.stackGraph.scheduled.backupRetentionTimeDelta` have changed format from Python timedelta to GNU `date --date`. If the values have been overridden in the value files they have to be adjusted for the new format.

For example,
```yaml
backup:
  stackGraph:
    scheduled:
      backupRetentionTimeDelta: days = 30
  configuration:
    scheduled:
      backupRetentionTimeDelta: days = 365
```

has to be replaced with

```yaml
backup:
  stackGraph:
    scheduled:
      backupRetentionTimeDelta: 30 days ago
  configuration:
    scheduled:
      backupRetentionTimeDelta: 365 days ago
```
