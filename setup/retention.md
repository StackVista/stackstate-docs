# Data retention

{% hint style="warning" %}
**This page describes StackState version 4.0.**

The StackState 4.0 version range is End of Life \(EOL\) and **no longer supported**. We encourage customers still running the 4.0 version range to upgrade to a more recent release.

Go to the [documentation for the latest StackState release](https://docs.stackstate.com/).
{% endhint %}

StackState imposes data retention limits to save storage space and improve performance.

## Retention of topology graph data

By default topology graph data will be retained for 8 days. This works in a way that the latest state of topology graph will always be retained; only history older than 8 days will be removed. If you want to have this altered, there is a StackState CLI route prepared for it. To check what is the current retention period, you can use the following StackState CLI command:

```text
sts graph retention get-window
```

In some cases, it may be useful to keep historical data for more than eight days. To set a new retention period to e.g., 10 days, you can use the following command:

```text
sts graph retention set-window --window 864000000
```

\(note that time value is provided in milliseconds - 10 days equals 864000000 milliseconds\)

Please note that by adding more time to the data retention period, the amount of data stored is also going to grow and need more storage space. This may also affect the performance of the Views.

After the new retention window is applied, you can schedule a new removal with this command:

```text
sts graph retention set-window --schedule-removal
```

After changing the retention period to a smaller window, you may end up with some data that is already expired and will wait there until the next scheduled cleanup. To schedule an additional removal of expired data, use the following command:

Please note that this may take some time to have an effect.

```text
sts graph retention remove-expired-data
```

However, if you would like to perform data deletion without having to wait for an additional scheduled cleanup, you can use `--immediately` argument:

```text
sts graph retention remove-expired-data --immediately
```

## Retention of metrics/events

If you are using the metric/event store provided with StackState, your data will be retained for a month. If you have configured your data source to be accessed by StackState, the retention policy is determined by the metric/event store you connected.
