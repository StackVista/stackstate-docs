# Requirements

## Overview

This page details the requirements for all supported installations of StackState:

* [Kubernetes and OpenShift](#kubernetes-and-openshift)
* [KOTS](#kots)
* [Linux](#linux)

Requirements for [networking](#networking) and the [StackState client \(browser\)](#client-browser) can be found at the bottom of the page.

## Kubernetes and OpenShift

### Supported versions

StackState can be installed on a Kubernetes or OpenShift cluster using the Helm charts provided by StackState. These Helm charts require Helm v3.x to install and are supported on:

* **Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS):** 1.20 to 1.23
* **Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS):** 1.20 to 1.23
* **OpenShift:** 4.8 to 4.10

### Node sizing

For a standard deployment, the StackState Helm chart will deploy backend services in a redundant setup with 3 instances of each service. The number of nodes required for environments with out-of-the-box settings are listed below, note that these may change based on system tuning:

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Recommended setup" %}
Requirements for the recommended high availability setup:

* **Amazon EKS:** 8 instances of type `m5.2xlarge` or `m4.2xlarge`
* **Azure AKS:** 8 instances of type `D8s v3` or `D8as V4` \(Intel or AMD CPUs\)
* **Virtual machines:** 8 nodes with `32GB memory`, `8 vCPUs`
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Minimal setup" %}
Requirements for the minimal high availability setup: 

* **Amazon EKS:** 5 instances of type `m5.2xlarge` or `m4.2xlarge`
* **Azure AKS:** 5 instances of type `D8s v3` or `D8as V4` \(Intel or AMD CPUs\)
* **Virtual machines:** 5 nodes with `32GB memory`, `8 vCPUs`
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Non-high availability setup" %}
Optionally, a [non-high availability setup](/setup/install-stackstate/kubernetes_install/non_high_availability_setup.md) can be configured which has the following requirements:

* **Amazon EKS:** 4 instances of type `m5.2xlarge` or `m4.2xlarge`
* **Azure AKS:** 4 instances of type `D8s v3` or `D8as V4` \(Intel or AMD CPUs\)
* **Virtual machines:** 4 nodes with `32GB memory`, `8 vCPUs`
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

### Docker images

For a list of all Docker images used, see the [image overview](/setup/install-stackstate/kubernetes_install/image_configuration.md).

### Storage

StackState uses persistent volume claims for the services that need to store data. The default storage class for the cluster will be used for all services unless this is overridden by values specified on the command line or in a `values.yaml` file. All services come with a pre-configured volume size that should be good to get you started, but can be customized later using variables as required.

For more details on the defaults used, see the page [Configure storage](/setup/install-stackstate/kubernetes_install/storage.md).

### Ingress

By default, the StackState Helm chart will deploy a router pod and service. This service's port `8080` is the only entry point that needs to be exposed via Ingress. You can access StackState without configuring Ingress by forwarding this port:

```text
kubectl port-forward service/<helm-release-name>-distributed-router 8080:8080
```

When configuring Ingress, make sure to allow for large request body sizes \(50MB\) that may be sent occasionally by data sources like the StackState Agent or the AWS integration.

For more details on configuring Ingress, have a look at the page [Configure Ingress docs](/setup/install-stackstate/kubernetes_install/ingress.md).

### Namespace resource limits

It is not recommended to set a ResourceQuota as this can interfere with resource requests. The resources required by StackState will vary according to the features used, configured resource limits and dynamic usage patterns, such as Deployment or DaemonSet scaling.

If it is necessary to set a ResourceQuota for your implementation, the namespace resource limit should be set to match the node sizing requirements. For example, using the recommended node sizing for virtual machines \(6 nodes with `32GB memory`, `8 vCPUs`\), the namespace resource limit should be `6*32GB = 192GB` and `6*8 vCPUs = 48 vCPUs`.


## KOTS 

### Operating system

KOTS requires a VM running a [supported OS \(kurl.sh\)](https://kurl.sh/docs/install-with-kurl/system-requirements).

### Disk Partitioning 

For a KOTS deployment, the disks should be partitioned as follows:

* `/` - at least 80GB
* `/var/lib/longhorn` - at least 500GB 

### Latency

The `/var/lib/longhorn` disk should have a latency of less than 10ms. 

For example, the cloud VM instance/disk combinations below are known to provide sufficient performance for etcd and will pass the write latency preflight check.

* **Amazon:** `m4.x2large` with 80 GB standard EBS root device
* **Azure:** `D8as V4` with 80 GB ultra disk mounted at `/var/lib/etcd` provisioned with 2400 IOPS and 128 MB/s throughput
* **Google Cloud Platform:** `n1-standard-8` with 500 GB pd-standard boot disk

### Node sizing

For a standard deployment, KOTS deploys backend services in a redundant setup with 3 instances of each service. The nodes required for different environments are listed below:

{% tabs %} 
{% tab title="Recommended setup" %} 
Requirements for the recommended high availability setup:

* **Amazon EC2:** 8 instances of type `m5.2xlarge` or `m4.2xlarge`
* **Azure:** 8 instances of type `D8s v3` or `D8as V4` (Intel or AMD CPUs)
* **Virtual machines**: 8 nodes with 32GB memory, 8 vCPUs

{% endtab %}
{% tab title="Minimal setup" %} 
Requirements for the recommended high availability setup:

* **Amazon EC2:** 5 instances of type `m5.2xlarge` or `m4.2xlarge`
* **Azure:** 5 instances of type `D8s v3` or `D8as V4` (Intel or AMD CPUs)
* **Virtual machines:** 5 nodes with 32GB memory, 8 vCPUs

{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}
