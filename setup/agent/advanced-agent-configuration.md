# Advanced Agent configuration

## Overview

A number of advanced configuration options are available for StackState Agent V2. These can be set either in the `stackstate.yaml` configuration file \(Linux and Windows\) or using environment variables \(Docker, Kubernetes and OpenShift\).

## Reduce data production

The StackState Agent collection interval can be configured. This will reduce the amount of data produced by the Agent.

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Kubernetes, OpenShift" %}
To configure the collection interval of the Kubernetes and system level integrations, create a `values.yaml` file with the below contents and specify this when you install/upgrade the StackState Agent. In this `values.yaml` example, the `min_collection_interval` has been set to double the default setting. This should result in a noticeable drop in the amount of data produced. If required, you can increase the interval further, however, the aim should be to find a balance between the frequency of data collection and the amount of data received by StackState: 

{% hint style="info" %}
Note that the `values.yaml` example below includes configuration to [enable clusterChecks](/setup/agent/kubernetes.md#enable-cluster-checks) and [run the Kubernetes_state check as a cluster check](/setup/agent/kubernetes.md#kubernetes_state-check-as-a-cluster-check).
{% endhint %}

```yaml
clusterChecks:
# clusterChecks.enabled -- Enables the cluster checks functionality _and_ the clustercheck pods.
  enabled: true

```

Specify the `values.yaml` file during installation / upgrade of the StackState Agent with the `--values` argument:

```bash
helm upgrade --install \
--namespace stackstate \
--create-namespace \
--set-string 'stackstate.apiKey=<your-api-key>' \
... (set all custom fields)
--values values.yaml
stackstate-cluster-agent stackstate/cluster-agent
```

{% tab title="Docker" %}

To reduce data production in StackState Agent running in a Docker container:

1. Configure the `min_collection_interval` for each of the following system integrations. The default setting is `15` seconds. Doubling this value should result in a noticeable drop in the amount of data produced. If required, you can increase the interval further, however, the aim should be to find a balance between the frequency of data collection and the amount of data received by StackState: 
   - **Memory** - `/etc/stackstate-agent/conf.d/memory.d/conf.yaml`
   - **CPU** - `/etc/stackstate-agent/conf.d/cpu.d/conf.yaml`
   - **Disk** - `/etc/stackstate-agent/conf.d/disk.d/conf.yaml`
   - **Load** - `/etc/stackstate-agent/conf.d/load.d/conf.yaml`
   - **File handle** - `/etc/stackstate-agent/conf.d/file_handle.d/conf.yaml`
2. Set the intervals for process, container and connection gathering in `/etc/stackstate-agent/stackstate.yaml`:
    ```yaml
    process_config:
      intervals:
        container: 40
        process: 30
        connections: 30
    ```
3. Mount the config files as a volume into the container running the Agent as described in [Docker Agent integration configuration](/setup/agent/docker.md#integration-configuration).

{% endtab %}

1. Configure the `min_collection_interval` for each of the following system integrations. The default setting is `15` seconds. Doubling this value should result in a noticeable drop in the amount of data produced. If required, you can increase the interval further, however, the aim should be to find a balance between the frequency of data collection and the amount of data received by StackState: 
   - **Memory** - `/etc/stackstate-agent/conf.d/memory.d/conf.yaml`
   - **CPU** - `/etc/stackstate-agent/conf.d/cpu.d/conf.yaml`
   - **Disk** - `/etc/stackstate-agent/conf.d/disk.d/conf.yaml`
   - **Load** - `/etc/stackstate-agent/conf.d/load.d/conf.yaml`
   - **File handle** - `/etc/stackstate-agent/conf.d/file_handle.d/conf.yaml`
2. Set the intervals for process, container and connection gathering in `/etc/stackstate-agent/stackstate.yaml`:
    ```yaml
    process_config:
      intervals:
        container: 40
        process: 30
        connections: 30
    ```

{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Windows" %}

To reduce data production in StackState Agent running on Windows:

1. Configure the `min_collection_interval` for each of the following system integrations. The default setting is `15` seconds. Doubling this value should result in a noticeable drop in the amount of data produced. If required, you can increase the interval further, however, the aim should be to find a balance between the frequency of data collection and the amount of data received by StackState: 
   - **Memory** - `C:\ProgramData\StackState\conf.d\memory.d\conf.yaml`
   - **CPU** - `C:\ProgramData\StackState\conf.d\cpu.d\conf.yaml`
   - **Disk** - `C:\ProgramData\StackState\conf.d\disk.d\conf.yaml`
   - **Load** - `C:\ProgramData\StackState\conf.d\load.d\conf.yaml`
   - **File handle** - `C:\ProgramData\StackState\conf.d\file_handle.d\conf.yaml`
2. Set the intervals for process, container and connection gathering in `C:\ProgramData\StackState\stackstate.yaml`:
    ```yaml
    process_config:
      intervals:
        container: 40

## Use a proxy for HTTP/HTTPS

The Agent can be configured to use a proxy for HTTP and HTTPS requests. For details, see [use an HTTP/HTTPS proxy](/setup/agent/agent-proxy.md).


## Blacklist and inclusions

Processes reported by StackState Agent V2 can optionally be filtered using a blacklist. Using this in conjunction with inclusion rules will allow otherwise excluded processes to be included.

The blacklist is specified as a list of regex patterns. Inclusions override the blacklist patterns, these are used to include processes that consume a lot of resources. Each inclusion type specifies an amount of processes to report as the top resource using processes. For `top_cpu` and `top_mem` a threshold must first be met, meaning that a process needs to consume a higher percentage of resources than the specified threshold before it is reported.

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Docker, Kubernetes, OpenShift" %}
To specify a blacklist and/or inclusions, set the associated environment variables and restart StackState Agent V2.

| Environment variable | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| `STS_PROCESS_BLACKLIST_PATTERNS` | A list of regex patterns that will exclude a process if matched. [Default patterns \(github.com\)](https://github.com/StackVista/stackstate-process-agent/blob/master/config/config_nix.go). |
