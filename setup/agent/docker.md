## Overview

{% hint style="info" %}
**StackState Agent V3**
{% endhint %}

StackState Agent V3 can run in a Docker container. The Agent collects data from the host where it's running and can be configured to integrate with external systems. Retrieved data is pushed to StackState, to work with this data the [StackState Agent V2 StackPack](../../stackpacks/integrations/agent.md) must be installed in your StackState instance. For details of the data retrieved and available integrations, see the [StackPack integration documentation](../../stackpacks/integrations/).

In Docker Swarm mode, the StackState Swarm Agent can be deployed on the manager node to retrieve topology data for the cluster.

## Monitoring

StackState Agent V3 will retrieve topology and metrics data from the host that it's running on. In [Docker swarm mode](#docker-swarm-mode), StackState Cluster Agent running on the manager node will synchronize data for a Docker cluster. For details, see the [data retrieved](#data-retrieved).

## Setup

### Single container

To start a single Docker container with StackState Agent V3, run the command below.

* `<STACKSTATE_RECEIVER_API_KEY>` is set during StackState installation.
* `<STACKSTATE_RECEIVER_API_ADDRESS>` is specific to your installation of StackState. 

For details see [StackState Receiver API](/setup/agent/about-stackstate-agent.md#connect-to-stackstate).

{% endcode %}

### Docker compose

To run StackState Agent V3 with Docker compose:

1. Add the following configuration to the compose file on each node where the Agent will run.
   * `<STACKSTATE_RECEIVER_API_KEY>` is set during StackState installation.
   * `<STACKSTATE_RECEIVER_API_ADDRESS>` is specific to your installation of StackState. 
   For details see [StackState Receiver API](/setup/agent/about-stackstate-agent.md#connect-to-stackstate).

   {% code lineNumbers="true" %}
   ```bash
   stackstate-agent:
    image: quay.io/stackstate/stackstate-agent:3.0.0
    network_mode: "host"
    pid: "host"
    privileged: true
    volumes:
      - "/var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock:ro"
      - "/proc/:/host/proc/:ro"
      - "/sys/fs/cgroup/:/host/sys/fs/cgroup:ro"
      - "/etc/passwd:/etc/passwd:ro"
      - "/sys/kernel/debug:/sys/kernel/debug"
    environment:
      STS_API_KEY: "<STACKSTATE_RECEIVER_API_KEY>"
      STS_STS_URL: "<STACKSTATE_RECEIVER_API_ADDRESS>"
      STS_PROCESS_AGENT_URL: "<STACKSTATE_RECEIVER_API_ADDRESS>"
      STS_PROCESS_AGENT_ENABLED: "true"
      STS_NETWORK_TRACING_ENABLED: "true"

      STS_APM_ENABLED: "true"
      HOST_PROC: "/host/proc"
      HOST_SYS: "/host/sys"
   ```
   {% endcode %}

3. Run the command:

   ```text
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

### Docker swarm mode

In Docker Swarm mode, the StackState Cluster Agent can be deployed on the manager node to retrieve basic topology data \(services, containers and the relations between them\). To retrieve full data, StackState Agent V3 must also be deployed on each node as a [Docker compose setup](docker.md#docker-compose).

To run StackState Swarm Agent in Docker Swarm mode:

1. Create a file `docker-compose.yml` with the following content. Update to include details of your StackState instance:
   * `<STACKSTATE_RECEIVER_API_KEY>` is set during StackState installation.
   * `<STACKSTATE_RECEIVER_API_ADDRESS>` is specific to your installation of StackState. 
   For details see [StackState Receiver API](/setup/agent/about-stackstate-agent.md#connect-to-stackstate).
   * `<CLUSTER_NAME>` is the name you would like to give this cluster

   {% code lineNumbers="true" %}
   ```bash
   stackstate-agent:
       image: quay.io/stackstate/stackstate-swarm-agent:2.19.1
       deploy:
         placement:
           constraints: [ node.role == manager ]
       volumes:
         - /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock:ro
         - /etc/passwd:/etc/passwd:ro
         - /sys/kernel/debug:/sys/kernel/debug
       environment:
         STS_API_KEY: "<STACKSTATE_RECEIVER_API_KEY>"
         STS_STS_URL: "<STACKSTATE_RECEIVER_API_ADDRESS>"
         STS_COLLECT_SWARM_TOPOLOGY: "true"
         STS_LOG_LEVEL: "debug"
         STS_LOG_TO_CONSOLE: "true"
         DOCKER_SWARM: "true"
         STS_CLUSTER_NAME: <CLUSTER_NAME>
   ```
   {% endcode %}

2. Run the command:

   ```text
   docker stack deploy -c docker-compose.yml
   ```

{% hint style="info" %}
Running the StackState Swarm Agent in Docker Swarm mode will collect basic topology data from the cluster. To retrieve more data, including telemetry, StackState Agent V3 must also be installed on each node in the Swarm cluster as a [Docker compose setup](docker.md#docker-compose).
{% endhint %}

### Upgrade

To upgrade StackState Agent V3 running inside a Docker container.

1. Stop the running container and remove it.

```text
docker stop stackstate-agent
docker container rm stackstate-agent
```

1. Run the container using the instructions provided in [setup](docker.md#setup).

## Configure

### Agent configuration

The StackState Agent V3 configuration is located in the file `/etc/stackstate-agent/stackstate.yaml`. The configuration file contains the `STS_API_KEY` and `STS_STS_URL` environment variables set when the Docker command is run. No further configuration should be required, however, a number of advanced configuration options are available.

### Advanced Agent configuration

StackState Agent V3 can be configured to reduce data production, tune the process blacklist, or turn off specific features when not needed. The required settings are described in detail on the page [advanced Agent configuration](advanced-agent-configuration.md).

### External integration configuration

StackState Agent V3 can be configured to run checks that integrate with external systems. Each integration has its own configuration file that's used by the associated Agent check. Configuration files for integrations that will run through StackState Agent V3 in Docker should be added as a volume to the directory `/etc/stackstate-agent/conf.d/` when the container is started.

For example, the Agent Docker configuration below includes a volume with a check configuration file for the ServiceNow integration:

{% code lineNumbers="true" %}
```bash
stackstate-agent:
    image: quay.io/stackstate/stackstate-agent:3.0.0
    network_mode: "host"
    pid: "host"
    privileged: true
    volumes:
      - "/var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock:ro"
      - "/proc/:/host/proc/:ro"
      - "/sys/fs/cgroup/:/host/sys/fs/cgroup:ro"
      - "/etc/passwd:/etc/passwd:ro"
      - "/sys/kernel/debug:/sys/kernel/debug"
      - "/etc/stackstate-agent/conf.d/servicenow.d/conf.yaml:/servicenow.d/conf.yaml:ro"
    environment:
      STS_API_KEY: "<STACKSTATE_RECEIVER_API_KEY>"
      STS_STS_URL: "<STACKSTATE_RECEIVER_API_ADDRESS>"
      HOST_PROC: "/host/proc"
      HOST_SYS: "/host/sys"
```
{% endcode %}

Documentation for the available StackState integrations, including how to configure the associated Agent checks, can be found on the [StackPacks &gt; Integrations pages](../../stackpacks/integrations/).

### Proxy configuration

The Agent can be configured to use a proxy for HTTP and HTTPS requests. For details, see [use an HTTP/HTTPS proxy](/setup/agent/agent-proxy.md).

### Self-Signed Certificates

If StackState Agent V3 will run checks that are configured to use self-signed certificates for HTTPs requests, override the `CURL_CA_BUNDLE` environment variable:

```text
  CURL_CA_BUNDLE = ""
```

### Traces

StackState Agent V3 can be configured to collect traces via a [StackState tracing integration](../../configure/traces/set-up-traces.md#2-configure-tracing-integrations). If the Agent will be used in conjunction with a language specific trace client, make sure to configure your app to use the hostâ€™s PID namespace:

```text
  service:
    ...
    pid: "host" # should match with processes reported by the StackState process Agent
    ...
```

## Commands

### Start or stop the Agent

To start, stop or restart StackState Agent V3, start or stop the container it's running in:

```text
# Start container
docker start stackstate-agent

# Stop container
docker stop stackstate-agent
```

### Status and information

For status information, refer to the Docker log files for the container.

To run the Agent status command inside a container:

```yaml
docker exec stackstate-agent bash -c 'agent status'
```

### Manually run a check

Use the command below to manually run an Agent check.

```yaml
# Execute a check once and display the results.
docker exec stackstate-agent bash -c 'agent check <CHECK_NAME>'

# Execute a check once with log level debug and display the results.
docker exec stackstate-agent bash -c 'agent check -l debug <CHECK_NAME>'
```

## Troubleshooting

To troubleshoot the Agent, try to [check the Agent status](docker.md#status) or [manually run a check](docker.md#manually-run-a-check).

### Log files

Docker logs for the StackState Agent V3 container can be followed using the command:

```text
docker logs -f stackstate-agent
```

Inside the running container, StackState Agent V3 logs are in the following files:

* `/var/log/stackstate-agent/agent.log`
* `/var/log/stackstate-agent/process-agent.log`

### Debug mode

By default, the log level of the Agent container is set to `INFO`. To assist in troubleshooting, the Agent log level can be set to `DEBUG`. This will enable verbose logging and all errors encountered will be reported in the Agent log files.

To set the log level to `DEBUG` for an Agent running on Docker, use the `STS_LOG_LEVEL` environment variable. Other optional logging settings:

* `STS_LOG_PAYLOADS: "true"` - include the topology/telemetry payloads sent to StackState in the Agent log.
* `STS_LOG_TO_CONSOLE: "true"` - write log output to the container stdout.

For example:
