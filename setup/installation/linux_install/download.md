{% hint style="warning" %}
**This page describes StackState v4.4.x.**

The StackState 4.4 version range is End of Life (EOL) and no longer supported. We encourage customers still running the 4.4 version range to upgrade to a more recent release.

Go to the [documentation for the latest StackState release](https://docs.stackstate.com/setup/installation/linux_install/download).
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
StackState prefers Kubernetes!  
In the future we will move away from Linux support. Read how to [migrate from the Linux install of StackState to the Kubernetes install](../kubernetes_install/migrate_from_linux.md).
{% endhint %}
