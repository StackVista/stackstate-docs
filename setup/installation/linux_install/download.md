**This page describes StackState version 4.3.**

The StackState 4.3 version range is End of Life (EOL) and no longer supported. We encourage customers still running the 4.3 version range to upgrade to a more recent release.

StackState prefers Kubernetes!  
In the future we will move away from Linux support. Read how to [migrate from the Linux install of StackState to the Kubernetes install](../kubernetes_install/migrate_from_linux.md).
