# Linux install

{% hint style="warning" %}
**This page describes StackState version 4.2**  
Go to the [documentation for the latest StackState release](https://docs.stackstate.com/).
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
StackState prefers Kubernetes!  
In the future we will move away from Linux support. Read how to [migrate from the Linux install of StackState to the Kubernetes install](../kubernetes_install/migrate_from_linux.md).
{% endhint %}

StackState can be installed either with Linux packages on one or two Linux machines or with Helm on a [Kubernetes cluster](../kubernetes_install/).

## Choosing your installation type

Before setting up StackState, you need to choose whether you want to run StackState in Development, POC, or Production mode.

* **Development setup:** requires only one machine, but will be limited to 1000 components/relations per view, due to the limited setup. This is recommended for small trials.
* **POC setup:** used for bigger installations, giving almost the same power as production, but is not suited for processing perpetual data streams.
* **Production setup:** used when bringing StackState to production or when the other environments are too limiting.

## Requirements

Before starting the installation, ensure your system\(s\) meet the StackState [installation requirements](../../requirements.md).

## Packages

There is an RPM package available that provides easy installation and upgrade of StackState on Fedora, Red Hat or CentOS. For Debian and Ubuntu, there is a DEB package available. Packages can be obtained from our [distribution website](download.md).

## Installation

StackState supports three different installation configurations:

* [**Production setup**](production-installation.md) suitable for production use.
* [**Proof-of-concept \(POC\) setup**](poc-installation.md) suitable for proof of concepts. This is not suited for processing perpetual data streams.
* [**Development setup**](development-installation.md) suitable for a pilot or demo. This setup can deal with limited amounts of topology \(max 1000 components/relations per view\).

## Upgrading

To upgrade your StackState installation, see the instructions in our [upgrading guide](../../upgrade-stackstate/steps-to-upgrade.md).

## Authentication and Authorization

StackState provides Role Based Access Control functionality that works with different authentication providers. See the [Authentication](../../../configure/security/authentication/authentication_options.md) and [RBAC](../../../configure/security/rbac/role_based_access_control.md) pages for more information on the topic.

## Troubleshooting

If you have any issues installing StackState, refer to our [troubleshooting guide](../troubleshooting.md) or contact our technical support.
