# Non-high availability setup

## Overview

The recommended Kubernetes deployment of StackState is a [production ready setup](/setup/installation/kubernetes_install/install_stackstate.md) with many services running redundantly. However, it is also possible to run StackState in a non-redundant setup, where each service has only a single replica.

This setup is only suitable for situations that do not require high availability.

## Non-high availability setup

To run StackState in a non-high availability setup:

1. Create a Helm values file `nonha_values.yaml` with the following content:

    ```yaml
    # This files defines additional Helm values to run StackState on a 
    # non-high availability production setup. Use this file in combination
    # with a regular values.yaml file that contains your API key, etc.
    elasticsearch:
      minimumMasterNodes: 1
      replicas: 1
    
    hbase:
      hbase:
        master:
          replicaCount: 1
        regionserver:
          replicaCount: 1
      hdfs:
        datanode:
          replicaCount: 1
        secondarynamenode:
          enabled: false
      tephra:
        replicaCount: 1
    
    kafka:
      replicaCount: 1
      defaultReplicationFactor: 1
      offsetsTopicReplicationFactor: 1
      transactionStateLogReplicationFactor: 1
    stackstate:
      components:
        ui:
          replicaCount: 1
    
    zookeeper:
      replicaCount: 1
    ```

2. Install StackState with the `nonha_values.yaml` Helm values file:
```bash
helm upgrade \
  --install \
  --namespace stackstate \
  --values values.yaml \
  --values nonha_values.yaml \
stackstate \
stackstate/stackstate
```
