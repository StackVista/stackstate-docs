# Reindexing StackState

{% hint style="warning" %}
**This page describes StackState version 4.0.**

The StackState 4.0 version range is End of Life \(EOL\) and **no longer supported**. We encourage customers still running the 4.0 version range to upgrade to a more recent release.

Go to the [documentation for the latest StackState release](https://docs.stackstate.com/).
{% endhint %}

StackState depends on a data model. When data model changes for any reason \(e.g., upgrade to a new version\) there is a need to run a reindexing process.

Reindex needs to be run in Terminal \(or other CLI\) on the machine that hosts StackState \(for the [production setup](production-installation.md)\).

First, make sure that StackState is not running with the following command:

`systemctl stop stackstate`

Then, make sure that StackGraph is running with the following command:

`systemctl start stackgraph`

Then execute the reindex command:

`sudo -u stackstate /opt/stackstate/bin/sts-standalone.sh reindex --graph default`

Please note that this is a long-running process - monitoring progress in StackState logs is advised.
