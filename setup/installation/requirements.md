## AWS requirements

To meet StackState minimal requirements the AWS instance type needs to have at least 4 CPU cores and 16GB of memory, e.g., m5.xlarge.

The AWS CLI has to be installed on the EC2 instance that is running StackState.

## Networking requirements

Listed ports are TCP ports.

### Development/POC deployment

StackState has to be reachable on port 7070 by any supported browser. StackState port 7077 must be reachable from any system that is pushing data to StackState

The following ports can be opened for monitoring, but are also useful when troubleshooting: 9001, 9002, 9003, 9004, 9005, 9006, 9010, 9011, 9020, 9021, 9022, 9023, 9024, 9025, 9026, 16010, 16030, 50070, 50075

### Production deployment

A production deployment separates StackState and StackState's database processes; StackGraph.

StackState has to be reachable on port 7070 by any supported browser. StackState port 7077 must be reachable from any system that is pushing data to StackState

StackGraph should be reachable by StackState on ports 2181, 8020, 15165, 16000, 16020, 50010.

The following ports can be opened for monitoring, but are also useful when troubleshooting:

* StackSate: 9010, 9011, 9020, 9021, 9022, 9023, 9024, 9025, 9026
* StackGraph: 9001, 9002, 9003, 9004, 9005, 9006, 16010, 16030, 50070, 50075
