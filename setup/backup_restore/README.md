# Backup and Restore


{% hint style="warning" %}
**This page describes StackState version 4.x.**

The StackState 4.0 version range is End of Life (EOL) and **no longer supported**. We encourage customers still running the 4.0 version range to upgrade to a more recent release.

Go to the [documentation for the latest StackState release](https://docs.stackstate.com/).
{% endhint %}

StackState offers backup and restore functionality on different levels. StackState's configuration can be exported and imported separately from the stored, topology/telemetry data.

The following pages describe the process of backup and restore for different use cases:

* [File based backup/restore](file.md)
* [Configuration backup/restore](configuration.md)
* [Manual topology backup/restore](manual_topology.md)
