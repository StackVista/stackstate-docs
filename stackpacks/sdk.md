# Develop your own StackPacks

{% hint style="warning" %}
This page describes StackState v4.5.x.
The StackState 4.5 version range is End of Life (EOL) and no longer supported. We encourage customers still running the 4.5 version range to upgrade to a more recent release.

Go to the [documentation for the latest StackState release](https://docs.stackstate.com/stackpacks/sdk).
{% endhint %}

StackState is designed to be extended with custom-built StackPacks. See our [Develop section](../develop/developer-guides/stackpack/) for more information.
