{% hint style="warning" %}
**This page describes StackState version 4.2.**

The StackState 4.2 version range is End of Life (EOL) and no longer supported. We encourage customers still running the 4.2 version range to upgrade to a more recent release.

Go to the [documentation for the latest StackState release](https://docs.stackstate.com/).
{% endhint %}

StackState is designed to be extended with custom-built StackPacks. See our [Develop section](../develop/developer-guides/stackpack/) for more information.
