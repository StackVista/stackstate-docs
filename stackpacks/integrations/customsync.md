# Custom Synchronization

{% hint style="warning" %}
This page describes StackState v4.5.x.
The StackState 4.5 version range is End of Life (EOL) and no longer supported. We encourage customers still running the 4.5 version range to upgrade to a more recent release.

Go to the [documentation for the latest StackState release](https://docs.stackstate.com/stackpacks/integrations/customsync).
{% endhint %}

## Overview

The Custom Synchronization StackPack contains everything you need to automatically synchronize topology information from an external topology source.

**Use the Custom Synchronization StackPack if you want to connect an external topology source that is not listed as a standard StackPack.**

Custom synchronization is a [StackState curated integration](/stackpacks/integrations/about_integrations.md#stackstate-curated-integrations).

## Next steps

Read up on [configuring synchronizations](../../configure/topology/sync.md), follow the [Push-Integration tutorial](../../develop/tutorials/push_integration_tutorial.md) or read the [Custom Synchronization developer guide](../../develop/developer-guides/custom_synchronization_stackpack/).

## Open-source

The Custom Synchronization StackPack is open-source and can be found [on StackState's github page](https://github.com/StackVista/stackpack-autosync).
