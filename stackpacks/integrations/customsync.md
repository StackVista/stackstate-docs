# Custom Synchronization

## Overview

The Custom Synchronization StackPack contains everything you need to automatically synchronize topology information from an external topology source.

**Use the Custom Synchronization StackPack if you want to connect an external topology source that is not listed as a standard StackPack.**

Custom synchronization is a [StackState curated integration](/stackpacks/integrations/about_integrations.md#stackstate-curated-integrations).

## Next steps

Read up on [configuring synchronizations](../../configure/topology/sync.md), follow the [Push-Integration tutorial](../../develop/tutorials/push_integration_tutorial.md) or read the [Custom Synchronization developer guide](../../develop/developer-guides/custom_synchronization_stackpack/).

## Open-source

The Custom Synchronization StackPack is open-source and can be found [on StackState's gitHub page](https://github.com/StackVista/stackpack-autosync).
