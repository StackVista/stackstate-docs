# Prerequisites

To set up a OpenTelemetry manual instrumentations, you need to have:

* [StackState Agent](/setup/agent/about-stackstate-agent.md) v2.17 (or later)
* [Traces enabled](/setup/agent/advanced-agent-configuration.md#enable-traces) on StackState Agent. If traces aren't enabled on the Agent, OpenTelemetry won't generate any data.
* The [Agent StackPack](/stackpacks/integrations/agent.md) should be installed in StackState.
