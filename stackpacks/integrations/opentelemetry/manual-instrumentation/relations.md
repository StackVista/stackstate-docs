# Relations between components

{% hint style="warning" %}
**This page describes StackState version 5.0.**

Go to the [documentation for the latest StackState release](https://docs.stackstate.com/stackpacks/integrations/opentelemetry/manual-instrumentation/relations).
{% endhint %}

## Overview

Component and span relations show the relationship between components in StackState. For example, the image below shows a relation running from a parent to a child component, that child also then has another component as a child component:

```text
Service Name: Parent Component
|
---> Service Name: Child Component
     |
     ---> Service Name: Child 2 Component
```

An example of the above displayed in StackState will show up as follows:

![Topology Perspective - Unmerged OTEL Components](../../../../.gitbook/assets/v50_otel_topology_perspective_healthy_component.png)

These relations are based on the parent and child structure. A relationship is drawn from a parent component to a child component. 

This means that:
* `Service Name: Child Component` has the parent ID set as `Service Name: Parent Component`
* `Service Name: Child 2 Component` has the parent ID set as `Service Name: Child Component`

## Health state propagation

In StackState, the health state of a component will propagate upwards through the dependency tree. This means that in the following situation:

```text
Service Name: Parent Component
|
---> Service Name: Child Component [400 Status]
     |
     ---> Service Name: Child 2 Component
```

The following components will have a propagated CRITICAL state:

```text
Service Name: Parent Component [Propagated 400 Status]
|
---> Service Name: Child Component [400 Status]
     |
     ---> Service Name: Child 2 Component
```

A visual example of this in the StackState UI will be as follows:

![Topology Perspective - OTEL Components CRITICAL State](../../../../.gitbook/assets/v50_otel_topology_perspective_critical_component.png)

So remember to create your parent and children spans in the correct order as it may affect the propagation of health state.

## Relations when merging

Relations are retained when merging components; this allows you to create a parent component, create a child component for this parent
and then merge that child component with an existing component. This will then create a relationship between the pre-existing component that the child component merged with and the parent component. For example, here we have the three components as described above:

![Topology Perspective - OTEL Components and Pre-Existing Components](../../../../.gitbook/assets/v50_otel_scenario_pre-existing_components.png)

If we then merge our middle component `Service Name: Child Component` with the existing healthy Lambda component `otel-example-custom-instrumentation-dev-create-custom-component` in the bottom right corner:

* The middle component will disappear (merged with the Lambda component)
* The Lambda component will have relations to the first and third components (inherited relation mappings from the middle component).

## Multiple children

It is also good to know that a single parent can have multiple children. This allows you to build a tree with branches of relations, for example:

```text
Service Name: Parent Component
|
---> Service Name: Child Component
|
---> Service Name: Child 2 Component
```
