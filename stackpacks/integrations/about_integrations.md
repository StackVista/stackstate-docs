# About integrations

{% hint style="warning" %}
**This page describes StackState v4.4.x.**

The StackState 4.4 version range is End of Life (EOL) and no longer supported. We encourage customers still running the 4.4 version range to upgrade to a more recent release.

Go to the [documentation for the latest StackState release](https://docs.stackstate.com/stackpacks/integrations/about_integrations).
{% endhint %}

## Overview

StackState integrations are split into three groups - core, curated and community. The differences between the three groups are described on this page.

* [StackState core integrations](about_integrations.md#stackstate-core-integrations)
* [StackState curated integrations](about_integrations.md#stackstate-curated-integrations)
* [Community integrations](about_integrations.md#community-integrations)

The description at the top of each integration's documentation page will clearly state if it is a core, curated or community integration.

## StackState core integrations

Core integrations are the main set of StackState integrations. These integrations cover cloud and container, ITSM, APM and log aggregation tools. All core integrations are continuously updated and maintained by StackState.

Documentation for the StackState core integrations can be found at the top of the **StackPacks** &gt; **integrations** menu with a ðŸ’  icon next to the integration name. Core integrations are also listed at the top of the [integrations overview page](./).

## StackState curated integrations

Curated integrations are developed and maintained by StackState. Updates are planned in response to feature requests or bugs raised.

Documentation for curated integrations is available in the **StackPacks** &gt; **integrations** menu underneath the StackState core integrations. Curated and community integrations are also listed on the [integrations overview page](./).

## Community integrations

Community integrations are developed in response to specific customer requests. Documentation is available in the **StackPacks** &gt; **integrations** menu. Curated and community integrations are also listed on the [integrations overview page](./).
