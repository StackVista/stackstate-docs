# About integrations

## Overview

Rancher Observability integrations are split into three groups - core, curated and community. The differences between the three groups are described on this page.

* [Rancher Observability core integrations](about_integrations.md#stackstate-core-integrations "Rancher Observability Self-Hosted only")
* [Rancher Observability curated integrations](about_integrations.md#stackstate-curated-integrations)
* [Community integrations](about_integrations.md#community-integrations)

The description at the top of each integration's documentation page will clearly state if it's a core, curated or community integration.

## Rancher Observability core integrations

Core integrations are the main set of Rancher Observability integrations. These integrations cover cloud and container, ITSM, APM and log aggregation tools. All core integrations are continuously updated and maintained by Rancher Observability.

Documentation for the Rancher Observability core integrations can be found at the top of the **StackPacks** &gt; **integrations** menu with a ðŸ’  icon next to the integration name. Core integrations are also listed at the top of the [integrations overview page](/stackpacks/integrations/README.md).

## Rancher Observability curated integrations

Curated integrations are developed and maintained by Rancher Observability. Updates are planned in response to feature requests or bugs raised.

Documentation for curated integrations is available in the **StackPacks** &gt; **integrations** menu underneath the Rancher Observability core integrations. Curated and community integrations are also listed on the [integrations overview page](/stackpacks/integrations/README.md).

## Community integrations

Community integrations are developed in response to specific customer requests. Documentation is available in the **StackPacks** &gt; **integrations** menu. Curated and community integrations are also listed on the [integrations overview page](/stackpacks/integrations/README.md).
