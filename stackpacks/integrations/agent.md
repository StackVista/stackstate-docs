# ðŸ’  StackState Agent V2

## Overview

The StackState Agent V2 StackPack works with [StackState Agent V2](../../setup/agent/about-stackstate-agent.md) to synchronize topology, metrics, events and traces data from external systems with StackState. A number of integrations are automatically enabled when the StackState Agent V2 StackPack is installed, however, integration with some systems will require an additional StackPack and configuration.
