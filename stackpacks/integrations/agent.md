# ðŸ’  StackState Agent V2

## Overview

The StackState Agent V2 StackPack works with [StackState Agent V2](../../setup/agent/about-stackstate-agent.md) to synchronize topology, metrics, events and traces data from external systems with StackState. A number of integrations are automatically enabled when the StackState Agent V2 StackPack is installed, however, integration with some systems will require an additional StackPack and configuration.

## Setup

### Prerequisites

* [StackState Agent V2](../../setup/agent/about-stackstate-agent.md) installed on a machine that can connect to StackState and any system you will integrate with.

### Install

Install the StackState Agent V2 StackPack from the StackState UI **StackPacks** &gt; **Integrations** screen.

### Configure

The integrations included in the StackState Agent V2 StackPack are listed below. Refer to the integration pages to find configuration details for each integration:

* [Apache TomCat](apache-tomcat.md "StackState Self-Hosted only")
* [AWS ECS](aws/aws-ecs.md)
* [AWS Xray](aws/aws-x-ray.md)
* [DotNet APM](dotnet-apm.md "StackState Self-Hosted only")
* [Java APM](java-apm.md)
* [JMX](jmx.md "StackState Self-Hosted only")
* [MySQL](mysql.md "StackState Self-Hosted only")
* [PostgreSQL](postgresql.md "StackState Self-Hosted only")
* [Static Health](static_health.md "StackState Self-Hosted only")  
* [WMI](wmi.md "StackState Self-Hosted only")

### Status

To find the status of an installed Agent, use the status commands provided in the [StackState Agent documentation](../../setup/agent/).

### Upgrade

When a new version of the StackState Agent V2 StackPack is available in your instance of StackState, you will be prompted to upgrade in the StackState UI on the page **StackPacks** &gt; **Integrations** &gt; **StackState Agent V2**. 

{% hint style="success" "self-hosted info" %}

For an overview of recent StackPack updates, check the [StackPack versions](/setup/upgrade-stackstate/stackpack-versions.md) shipped with each StackState release.
{% endhint %}

To upgrade StackState Agent V2, see the [StackState Agent documentation](../../setup/agent/).

## Integration details

### Data retrieved

When installed and running, StackState Agent V2 will synchronize the following data with StackState from the host it is running on:

Linux:

* Hosts, processes and containers
* Network connections between processes and containers including network traffic telemetry
* Telemetry for hosts, processes and containers 

Docker:

* Hosts, processes, and containers
* Network connections between processes, containers and services including network traffic telemetry
* Telemetry for hosts, processes, and containers
* Trace agent support

When additional checks have been enabled on the Agent, data from other external systems will be integrated. Refer to the individual integration pages for details of the data retrieved from each system.
