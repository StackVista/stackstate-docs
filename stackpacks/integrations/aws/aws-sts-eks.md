# StackState/Agent IAM role for EKS

## Overview

If StackState or StackState Agent V2 are running within an AWS environment in an EKS cluster instance, an IAM role can be attached to the node-group where the pods `stackstate-api` and/or `stackstate-cluster-agent` are running. 

* `stackstate-api` pod - StackState running in these pods can use the attached role for authentication.
* `stackstate-cluster-agent` pod -  StackState Cluster Agent running in this pod can use the attached role for authentication.

{% hint style="info" %}
Note: If the AWS Data Collection Account and the Monitor Account aren't a part of the same AWS organization, it's impossible to authenticate using the attached IAM role in this way. For details see the AWS documentation on [AWS organizations \(docs.aws.amazon.com\)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/userguide/orgs_introduction.html). 
{% endhint %}

## Set up IAM role for StackState/StackState Agent on EKS

To set up an IAM role for StackState or StackState Agent to use, follow the instructions below.

1. If you did not do so already, [create a policy](/stackpacks/integrations/aws/aws.md#aws-policy) that allows the `AssumeRole` action for the resource `arn:aws:iam::*:role/StackStateAwsIntegrationRole`. Take note of the policy name.
2. Find the node-group that contains nodes running the relevant pod or pods and create a node group role:
   * **StackState on EKS**: `stackstate-api`.
   * **StackState Agent on EKS**: `stackstate-cluster-agent`.
3. Attach the policy from the first step to the node-group role from the previous step.

4. Configure the StackPack instance or Agent AWS check to [authenticate using the attached IAM role](/stackpacks/integrations/aws/aws.md#iam-role-on-ec2-or-eks).
