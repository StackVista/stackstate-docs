## Overview

The StackState Agent can be configured to execute Splunk saved searches and provide the results as generic events to the StackState receiver API. It will dispatch the saved searches periodically, specifying last event timestamp to start with up until now.

The StackState Agent expects the results of the saved searches to be according to the Events Query Format, which is described below. It requires the `_time` format, and has the following optional fields: `event_type`, `msg_title`, `message_text` and `source_type_name`. If there are other fields present in the result, they will be mapped to tags, where the column name is the key, and the content the value. The Agent will filter out Splunk default fields \(except `_time`\), like e.g. `_raw`, see the [Splunk documentation](https://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/Splunk/6.5.2/Data/Aboutdefaultfields) for more information about default fields.

The agent check prevents sending duplicate events over multiple check runs. The received saved search records have to be uniquely identified for comparison. By default, a record's identity is composed of Splunk's default fields `_bkt` and `_cd`. The default behavior can be changed for each saved search by setting the `unique_key_fields` in the check's configuration. Please note that the specified `unique_key_fields` fields become mandatory for each record. In case the records can not be uniquely identified by a combination of fields then the whole record can be used by setting `unique_key_fields` to `[]`, i.e. empty list.

### Events Query Format

| **\_time\*** | long | Data collection timestamp, millis since epoch |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **event\_type** | string | Event type, e,g, server\_created |
| **msg\_title** | string | Message title |
| **msg\_text** | string | Message text |
| **source\_type\_name** | string | Source type name |

\* Required columns

## Example

Example Splunk query:

```text
index=monitor alias_hostname=*
| eval status = upper(status)
| search status=CRITICAL OR status=error OR status=warning OR status=OK
| table _time hostname status description
```

## Authentication

The Splunk integration provides various authentication mechanisms to connect to your Splunk instance.

### HTTP Basic Authentication

With HTTP basic authentication, the `username` and `password` specified in the `splunk_events.yaml` can be used to connect to Splunk. These parameters are available in `basic_auth` parameter under the `authentication` section. Credentials under the root of the configuration file are deprecated and credentials provided in the new `basic_auth` section will override the root credentials.

_As an example, see the below config :_

```text
instances:
    - url: "https://localhost:8089"

    # username: "admin" ## deprecated; use basic_auth.username under authentication section
    # password: "admin" ## deprecated; use basic_auth.password under authentication section

    # verify_ssl_certificate: false

    ## Integration supports either basic authentication or token based authentication.
    ## Token based authentication is preferred before basic authentication.
    authentication:
      basic_auth:
        username: "admin"
        password: "admin"
```

### Token-based Authentication

Token-based authentication mechanism supports Splunk authentication tokens. An initial Splunk token is provided to the integration with a short expiration date. The integration's authentication mechanism will request a new token before expiration, respecting the `renewal_days` setting, with an expiration of `token_expiration_days` days.

Token-based authentication information overrides basic authentication in case both are configured.

The following new parameters are available:

* `name` - Name of the user who will be using this token.
* `initial_token` - First initial valid token which will be exchanged with new generated token in the integration.
* `audience` - JWT audience name which is purpose of token.
* `token_expiration_days` - Validity of the newly requested token after first initial token and by default it's 90 days.
* `renewal_days` - Number of days before when token should refresh, by default it's 10 days.

_As an example, see the below config :_

```text
instances:
    - url: "https://localhost:8089"

    # username: "admin" ## deprecated; use basic_auth.username under authentication section
    # password: "admin" ## deprecated; use basic_auth.password under authentication section

    # verify_ssl_certificate: false

    ## Integration supports either basic authentication or token based authentication.
    ## Token based authentication is preferred before basic authentication.
    authentication:
      # basic_auth:
        # username: "admin"
        # password: "admin"

      token_auth:
        ## Token for the user who will be using it
        name: "api-user"

        ## The initial valid token which will be exchanged with new generated token as soon as the check starts
        ## first time and in case of restart, this token will not be used anymore
        initial_token: "my-initial-token-hash"

        ## JWT audience used for purpose of token
        audience: "search"

        ## When a token is about to expire, a new token is requested from Splunk. The validity of the newly requested
        ## token is requested to be `token_expiration_days` days. After `renewal_days` days the token will be renewed
        ## for another `token_expiration_days` days.
        token_expiration_days: 90

        ## the number of days before when token should refresh, by default it's 10 days.
        renewal_days: 10
```

The above authentication configuration are part of the [conf.d/splunk\_events.yaml](https://github.com/StackVista/sts-agent-integrations-core/blob/master/splunk_event/conf.yaml.example) file.

## Configuration

1. Edit your `conf.d/splunk_events.yaml` file.
2. Restart the agent
