{% hint style="warning" %}
This page describes StackState v4.5.x.
The StackState 4.5 version range is End of Life (EOL) and no longer supported. We encourage customers still running the 4.5 version range to upgrade to a more recent release.

Go to the [documentation for the latest StackState release](https://docs.stackstate.com/stackpacks/integrations/prometheus).

## Overview

StackState can be configured to pull telemetry data from an external Prometheus system. This integration is not set up using a StackPack.
