# VMware vSphere

{% hint style="warning" %}
**This page describes StackState version 4.1.** 

The StackState 4.1 version range is End of Life \(EOL\) and no longer supported. We encourage customers still running the 4.1 version range to upgrade to a more recent release.

Go to the [documentation for the latest StackState release](https://docs.stackstate.com/).
{% endhint %}

## What is the VMware vSphere StackPack?

The VMware vSphere StackPack is used to create a near real-time synchronization with VMware vSphere.

This StackPack provides functionality that allows for monitoring of the following resources:

* hosts
* virtual machines
* compute resources
* cluster compute resources
* data stores
* data centers

VMware StackPack collects all topology data for the components and relations between them as well as telemetry and events.

## Prerequisites

* [StackState Agent V2](agent.md) must be installed on a single machine that can connect to VSphere VCenter and StackState.
* A VSphere VCenter instance must be running.

### Network communication

* The [StackState Agent V2](agent.md) connects to the vSphere instance on TCP port 443.
* The [StackState Agent V2](agent.md) connects to StackState API on TCP port 7077
* If the Agent is installed on the StackState host then port 7077 is localhost communication.
* If the Agent is installed on a different host, you need a network path between the Agent and StackState on port 7077/tcp, and to vSphere on 443/tcp port.

## Enable vSphere integration

To enable the vSphere check and begin collecting data from your VSphere VCenter instance:

1. Edit the Agent integration configuration file `/etc/stackstate-agent/conf.d/vsphere.d/conf.yaml` to include details of your VSphere VCenter instance:
   * **name**
   * **host** - the same as the `vSphere Host Name` used in the StackPack provisioning process.
   * **username**
   * **password** - use [secrets management](../../configure/security/secrets_management.md) to store passwords outside of the configuration file.

     ```text
     # Section used for global vsphere check config
     init_config:

     instances:
     # name must be a unique key representing your vCenter instance
     # mandatory
     - name: <name> # main-vcenter

       # the host used to resolve the vCenter IP
       # mandatory
       host: <host_name> # vcenter.domain.com

       # Read-only credentials to connect to vCenter
       # mandatory
       username: <username> # stackstate-readonly@vsphere.local
       password: <password> # mypassword

       # Set to false to disable SSL verification, when connecting to vCenter
       # optional
       ssl_verify: false
     ```
2. [Restart the StackState Agent\(s\)](agent.md#start-stop-restart-the-stackstate-agent) to publish the configuration changes.
3. Once the Agent is restarted, wait for the Agent to collect the data and send it to StackState.

## Configuration options

The following configuration options can be added to the vSphere configuration file. Find details in the [`conf.yaml.example` file](https://github.com/StackVista/sts-agent-integrations-core/blob/master/vsphere/conf.yaml.example)

| Options | Required? | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `ssl_verify` | No | Set to false to disable SSL verification, when connecting to vCenter. |
| `ssl_classpath` | No | Set to the absolute file path of a directory that contains CA certificates in PEM format, e.g. `/path/to/file.pem` |
| `host_include_only_regex` | No | Use a regex [like this - conf.yaml](https://github.com/StackVista/sts-agent-integrations-core/blob/master/vsphere/conf.yaml.example), if you want the check to only fetch metrics for these ESXi hosts and the VMs running on it. |
| `vm_include_only_regex` | No | Use a regex to include only the VMs that are matching this pattern. More details in [conf.yaml](https://github.com/StackVista/sts-agent-integrations-core/blob/master/vsphere/conf.yaml.example) |
| `include_only_marked` | No | Set to true, if you would like to only collect metrics on vSphere VMs that are marked by a custom field with the value  `DatadogMonitored`. |
| `collection_level` | No | A number between 1 and 4 to specify how many metrics are sent, 1 meaning only important monitoring metrics, and 4 meaning every metric available. |

## Special tags

The vSphere StackPack understands the following special tags:

|  |  |
| :--- | :--- |
| `stackstate-identifier` | Adds the specified value as an identifier to the StackState component |

## Data collected
