# Health synchronization

## Overview

Health synchronization allows you to add existing health checks from external monitoring systems to StackState topology elements. Health data is calculated in the external monitoring system using its own data and rules, then automatically synchronized and attached to the associated topology elements in StackState.


## Set up health synchronization
The StackState receiver API will automatically receive and process all incoming health data. No additional configuration is required in StackState to enable this, however, the health data received should match the expected JSON format.

Details on how to ingest health data can be found on the following pages:

* [Ingest health data through the StackState Receiver API](/configure/health/send-health-data.md)
* [Create an Agent check to ingest health data using the StackState Agent](/develop/developer-guides/agent_check/how_to_develop_agent_checks.md)

## Health synchronization pipeline

The health synchronization framework works as follows: 

* Health data is sent to StackState and ingested via the Receiver API.
* StackState topology elements related to the ingested health checks are identified and bound based on:
    - the [topology identifiers](../topology/sync.md#id-extraction) obtained during topology synchronization.
    - the [topologyElementIdentifier](send-health-data.md#json-property-health) from the ingested health payload.
* StackState keeps track of changes to both topology elements and health checks to maintain up to date information.

### Consistency models
StackState health synchronization relies on different consistency models to guarantee that the data sent from an external monitoring system matches with what StackState ingests and shows. The two supported consistency models are: `Repeat Snapshots`, `Repeat States` and `Transactional Increments`.

{% tab title="Repeat snapshots" %}
### Overview
Relies on periodically receiving the full snapshot of how the external checks look like in the external monitoring system. StackState keeps track of the external checks on each received snapshot and decides if some external check states need to be created, updated or deleted (as if they are not present on a snapshot anymore). The [Repeat Snapshots health payload](/configure/health/send-health-data/repeat_snapshots.md) accepts specific properties to specify when a snapshot starts or stops.

### When to use
This model can be used when the external monitoring system is capable of keeping the state of which elements are present in a determined time window and therefore can communicate how the full snapshot looks like. It offers full control over which external checks will be deleted as all decisions are inferred from the received snapshots. This model gives full control over the data that StackState will show as there's no ambiguity whether some external check should be present or not in StackState.

{% tab title="Repeat states" %}
### Overview
Relies on periodically receiving external checks from the external monitoring system. StackState keeps track of the external checks and decides if some external checks need to be created or updated. In order to delete external checks it uses a configurable expiry mechanism to delete external checks that are not observed anymore. The [Repeat States health payload](/configure/health/send-health-data/repeat_states.md) accepts specific properties to specify what the expiry configuration should be.

### When to use
This model can be used when the external monitoring system is not capable of collecting all the external check in a determined time window and the best effort is just to send the external checks as they are obtained. This model offers less control into the data as it relies on an expiry configuration to delete external checks and it might happen that elements are deleted due to barely missing the expiry timeout whcih would reflect as external checks disappearing and reappearing from StackState.
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Transactional increments" %}
### Overview
Is meant to be used on streaming systems where changes are signaled through a pipeline and only those individual health state changes can be delivered to StackState. As there is no repetition of data the whole consistency is handled by making sure that the entire pipeline can mantain at least once delivery guarantees. In order to achieve this StackState requires that a checkpoint and a previous checkpoints are communicated next to the check_states so it can track that no data is missing at all, metadata as `repeat_interval` or `expire_interval` are irrelevant in this case as there is no predefined periodicity on the data.

### When to use
This model can be used when the external monitoring system does not have access to the total external checks state but only works on an event based approach. Requires strict control across the whole pipeline in order to guarantee no data loss.

### Health stream and sub stream

External monitoring systems send health data to the StackState Receiver in a health stream. Each health stream contains at least one sub stream with health checks.

| | |
|:---|:---|
| **Health stream** | The Health stream uniquely identifies the health synchronization and defines the boundaries within which the health check states should be processed together. |
| **Sub stream** |  Sub streams contain the health check data that are processed by StackState. When working with health data from a distributed external monitoring system, multiple sub streams can be configured, each containing health data from a single location. The data in each sub stream is semi-independent, but contributes to the health check states of the complete health stream. If a single location is responsible for reporting the health check states of the health stream, the `sub_stream_id` can be omitted from the [health payload](/configure/health/send-health-data.md#json-property-health). StackState will assume that all the external health checks belong to a single, default sub stream. |

### Repeat Interval

Health synchronization processes the ingested health data per sub stream. The repeat interval specified in the [health payload](/configure/health/send-health-data.md#json-property-health) is the commitment from the external monitoring system to send complete data over and over in order to keep the data up to date on StackState. This is helpful for StackState to be able to inform the user how up to date the health synchronization is running.

### Expire Interval

The expire interval can be used to configure sub streams in the health synchronization to delete data that is not sent by the external system anymore. This is helpful in case the source for a sub stream could potentially be decommissioned and StackState would not hear from it again. Without an expire interval, the previously synchronized data would be left permanently hanging.

### Check State

The health check state calculated by an external monitoring system. This contains the relevant information to attach to a topology element and to contribute to the topology element health state.
