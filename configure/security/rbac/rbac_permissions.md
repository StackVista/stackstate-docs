## Permissions in StackState

Permissions in StackState are twofold: System permissions and View permissions. These two sets of permissions are prepared to allow Administrators to take control over actions that users can perform inside StackState, as well as adjusting a user's UI to fit their role. This means that StackState can present a completely different interface and feature set according to the user's active role. UI elements that users don't have access to are simply not displayed in their UI.

Please note that permissions are stored in StackGraph, so performing an upgrade with clear all data will also remove permission setup. Because permissions exist in StackGraph, in order to completely remove the user it needs to be removed from LDAP and from StackGraph manually.

## Views permissions and system permissions

Views permissions are a set of permissions that allow for CRUD operations with Views in StackState. System permissions are scoping user capabilities like access to settings, query execution or scripting.

## Predefined roles

StackState comes with three predefined roles - `stackstate-admin` \(Adminstrator\), `stackstate-power-user` \(Power user\) and `stackstate-guest` \(Guest user\).

* Administrators have all permissions and access to all views. 
* Power Users have all Administrator permissions _except_ update-permissions and upload-stackpacks. This role is typically granted to users that are not managing the entire StackState installation, but do need to configure StackState for their team\(s\).
* Guests have access to view, as you can see below:

```text
subject           permission            resource
----------------  --------------------  ----------
stackstate-guest  read-settings         system
stackstate-guest  access-explore        system
stackstate-guest  perform-custom-query  system
stackstate-guest  read-permissions      system
stackstate-guest  update-visualization  system
stackstate-guest  access-view           everything
```

The default names for these roles as mentioned above can be overriden, this mechanism can also be used to add extra roles that will have the same permissions. Here an example of how to do this for both Kubernetes and Linux instalaltions.

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Kubernetes" %}
Include this YAML snippet in an `authentication.yaml` when customizing the authentication configuration to replace the default role names with these custom role names.

```yaml
stackstate:
  authentication:
    roles:
      guest: ["custom-guest-role"]
      powerUser: ["custom-power-user-role"]
      admin: ["custom-admin-role"]
```

Of course it is also possible to leave the defaults in place, for example the `guestGroups` would then have an array with 2 entries: `["stackstate-guest", "custom-guest-role"]`.

To use it in for your StackState installation \(or already running instance, note that it will restart the API\):

```text
helm upgrade \
  --install \
  --namespace stackstate \
  --values values.yaml \
  --values authentication.yaml \
stackstate \
stackstate/stackstate
```
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Linux" %}
Edit the existing keys in the `authentication` section \(nested in `stackstate.api`\) in the configuration file like in the example to replace the default role names with these custom role names. Restart StackState to make the change take effect.

```javascript
  guestGroups = ["custom-guest-role"]
  powerUserGroups = ["custom-power-user-role"]
  adminGroups = ["custom-admin-role"]
}
```

Of course it is also possible to leave the defaults in place, for example the `guestGroups` would then have an array with 2 entries: `["stackstate-guest", "custom-guest-role"]`.
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}
