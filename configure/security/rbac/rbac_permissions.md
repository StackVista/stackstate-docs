# Permissions

{% hint style="warning" %}
**This page describes StackState version 4.1. **

The StackState 4.1 version range is End of Life (EOL) and no longer supported. We encourage customers still running the 4.1 version range to upgrade to a more recent release.

Go to the [documentation for the latest StackState release](https://docs.stackstate.com/).
{% endhint %}

## Permissions in StackState

Permissions in StackState are twofold: System permissions and View permissions. These two sets of permissions are prepared to allow administrators to take control over actions that users can perform inside StackState, as well as adjusting users' UI to their roles. This means that StackState can present a completely different interface and feature set according to the user's active role. UI elements that users don't have access to are simply not displayed in their UI.

Please note that permissions are stored in StackGraph, so performing an upgrade with clear all data will also remove permission setup. Because permissions exist in StackGraph, in order to completely remove the user it needs to be removed from LDAP and from StackGraph manually.

## Views permissions and system permissions

Views permissions are a set of permissions that allow for CRUD operations with Views in StackState. System permissions are scoping user capabilities like access to settings, query execution or scripting.

## Predefined Admin and Guest roles

StackState comes with two predefined roles - Admin and Guest. Admin is a power user that has all permissions and access to all views. On the other hand, the Guest user is fairly limited, as you can see below:

```text
subject           permission            resource
----------------  --------------------  ----------
stackstate-guest  read-settings         system
stackstate-guest  access-explore        system
stackstate-guest  perform-custom-query  system
stackstate-guest  read-permissions      system
stackstate-guest  update-visualization  system
stackstate-guest  access-view           everything
```
