## The Azure StackPack is installed

Congratulations! The Azure StackPack is configured correctly. Data is being received.

### What's next?

Now that Rancher Observability is receiving data from your Azure instance, you can see your topology in the Rancher Observability Azure views. A view will be created in Rancher Observability for each instance of the Azure StackPack. Each view shows components filtered by the Azure `instance_name` tag and is named **Azure_<instance_name>**.

Check the Rancher Observability docs for more details on [working with the Azure StackPack](https://l.stackstate.com/ui-azure-stackpack).
