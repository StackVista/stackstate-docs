# VMWare vSphere

{% hint style="warning" %}
**This page describes StackState version 4.0.**

The StackState 4.0 version range is End of Life \(EOL\) and **no longer supported**. We encourage customers still running the 4.0 version range to upgrade to a more recent release.

Go to the [documentation for the latest StackState release](https://docs.stackstate.com/).

## What is the VMWare vSphere StackPack?

The VMware vSphere StackPack is used to create a near real-time synchronization with VMware vSphere.

This StackPack provides functionality that allows for monitoring of the following resources:

* hosts
* virtual machines
* compute resources
* cluster compute resources
* data stores
* data centers

VMware StackPack collects all topology data for the components and relations between them as well as telemetry and events.

## Prerequisites

* StackState Agent V2 must be installed on a single machine which can connect to VSphere VCenter and StackState. \(See the [StackState Agent V2 StackPack](agent.md) for more details\)
* A VSphere VCenter instance must be running.

### Network communication

* The [StackState Agent V2](agent.md) connects to the vSphere instance on TCP port 443.
* The [StackState Agent V2](agent.md) connects to StackState API on TCP port 7077
* If the Agent is installed on the StackState host then port 7077 is localhost communication.
* If the Agent is installed on a different host, you need a network path between the Agent and StackState on port 7077/tcp, and to vSphere on 443/tcp port.

## Enabling the vSphere check

### Enabling the vSphere check using the StackState Agent StackPack and Agent v2

Edit the `conf.yaml` file in your agent `/etc/stackstate-agent/conf.d/vsphere.d` directory, replacing `<name>`, `<host_name>`, `<username>` and `<password>` with the information from your VSphere VCenter instance.

```text
# Section used for global vsphere check config
init_config:

instances:
  # name must be a unique key representing your vCenter instance
  # mandatory
  - name: <name> # main-vcenter

    # the host used to resolve the vCenter IP
    # mandatory
    host: <host_name> # vcenter.domain.com

    # Read-only credentials to connect to vCenter
    # mandatory
    username: <username> # stackstate-readonly@vsphere.local
    password: <password> # mypassword

    # Set to false to disable SSL verification, when connecting to vCenter
    # optional
    ssl_verify: false
```

To publish the configuration changes, restart the StackState Agent\(s\) using below command.

```text
sudo /etc/init.d/stackstate-agent restart
```

Once the Agent is restarted, wait for the Agent to collect the data and send it to StackState.

### Enabling the vSphere check using the API Integration StackPack and Agent v1

To enable the vSphere check which collects the data from vSphere vCenter:

Edit the `vsphere.yaml` file in your agent in `/etc/sts-agent/conf.d/`, replacing `<name>`, `<host_name>`, `<username>`, and `<password>` with the information from your vSphere vCenter instance.

```text
# Section used for global vsphere check config
init_config:

instances:
  # name must be a unique key representing your vCenter instance
  # mandatory
  - name: <name> # main-vcenter

    # the host used to resolve the vCenter IP
    # mandatory
    host: <host_name> # vcenter.domain.com

    # Read-only credentials to connect to vCenter
    # mandatory
    username: <username> # stackstate-readonly@vsphere.local
    password: <password> # mypassword

    # Set to false to disable SSL verification, when connecting to vCenter
    # optional
    ssl_verify: false
```

Please note that the value needs to be the same as `vSphere Host Name` used during StackPack provisioning process.

To apply the configuration changes, restart the StackState Agent using the below command.

```text
systemctl restart stackstate-agent
```

or

```text
service stackstate-agent restart
```

Once the Agent is restarted, it starts collecting data, and sends it to StackState.

## Configuration options

The following configuration options can be added to the vSphere configuration file. Find details in the [`conf.yaml.example` file](https://github.com/StackVista/sts-agent-integrations-core/blob/master/vsphere/conf.yaml.example)

| Options | Required? | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `ssl_verify` | No | Set to false to disable SSL verification, when connecting to vCenter. |
| `ssl_classpath` | No | Set to the absolute file path of a directory that contains CA certificates in PEM format, e.g. `/path/to/file.pem` |
| `host_include_only_regex` | No | Use a regex [like this - conf.yaml](https://github.com/StackVista/sts-agent-integrations-core/blob/master/vsphere/conf.yaml.example), if you want the check to only fetch metrics for these ESXi hosts and the VMs running on it. |
| `vm_include_only_regex` | No | Use a regex to include only the VMs that are matching this pattern. More details in [conf.yaml](https://github.com/StackVista/sts-agent-integrations-core/blob/master/vsphere/conf.yaml.example) |
| `include_only_marked` | No | Set to true, if you would like to only collect metrics on vSphere VMs that are marked by a custom field with the value  `DatadogMonitored`. |
| `collection_level` | No | A number between 1 and 4 to specify how many metrics are sent, 1 meaning only important monitoring metrics, and 4 meaning every metric available. |

## Special tags

The vSphere StackPack understands the following special tags:

|  |  |
| :--- | :--- |
| `stackstate-identifier` | Adds the specified value as an identifier to the StackState component |

## Data collected
