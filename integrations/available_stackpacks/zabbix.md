## What is the Zabbix StackPack?

The Zabbix StackPack is used to create a near real time synchronization with your Zabbix instance.

## Prerequisites

The following prerequisites need to be met:

* The StackState Agent StackPack must be installed on a single machine which can connect to Zabbix and StackState. \(See the [StackState Agent V2 StackPack](agent.md) for more details\).
* A Zabbix instance must be running.

**NOTE**: Zabbix versions 3 and 4 are supported.

## Enabling Zabbix integration

To enable the Zabbix check which collects the data from Zabbix instance:

Edit the `conf.yaml` file in your agent `/etc/stackstate-agent/conf.d/zabbix.d` directory, replacing `<url>`, `<username>` and `<password>` with the information from your Zabbix instance.

```text
# Section used for global Zabbix check config
init_config:

instances:
  # mandatory
  - url: <url> # http://10.0.0.1/zabbix/api_jsonrpc.php

    # Read-only credentials to connect to zabbix
    # mandatory
    username: <username> # Admin
    password: <password> # zabbix
```

To publish the configuration changes, restart the StackState Agent\(s\) using below command.

```text
sudo /etc/init.d/stackstate-agent restart
```

Once the Agent is restarted, wait for the Agent to collect the data and send it to StackState.
