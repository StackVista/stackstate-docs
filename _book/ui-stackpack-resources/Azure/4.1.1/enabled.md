## The Azure StackPack is installed

Congratulations! The Azure StackPack is configured correctly. Data is being received.

### What's next?

Now that StackState is receiving data from your Azure instance, you can see your topology in the StackState Azure views. A view will be created in StackState for each instance of the Azure StackPack. Each view shows components filtered by the Azure `instance_name` tag and is named **Azure_<instance_name>**.

Check the StackState docs for more details on [working with the Azure StackPack](https://l.stackstate.com/ui-azure-stackpack).

### Troubleshooting
