# draw.io source files

This directory includes all the draw.io files used to make diagrams for the docs site.

You can check them out, open them in [draw.io](https://draw.io) and make any required changes.

Note the following if you make updates to a diagram:

- As a guide, images on the site should be of size 1280x720px
- Diagrams should be exported as type **.svg**
- Images used in the docs site are in the directory `/.gitbook/assets`.
- Remember to include the updated draw.io file in your pr :)
