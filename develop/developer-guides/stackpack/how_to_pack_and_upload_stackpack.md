# Upload a StackPack file

The `.sts` file is a zip archive that contains the [StackPack file structure](prepare_package.md). When all files are in place, archive your StackPack directory into a `.zip` file and change its extension to `.sts`.

To upload the `.sts` file to StackState use the [StackState CLI](../../../setup/cli-install.md) with the following command: `sts stackpack upload path/to/file.sts`
