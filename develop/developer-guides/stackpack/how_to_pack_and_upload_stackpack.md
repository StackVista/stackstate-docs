# Upload a StackPack file

{% hint style="warning" %}
**This page describes StackState v4.4.x.**

The StackState 4.4 version range is End of Life (EOL) and no longer supported. We encourage customers still running the 4.4 version range to upgrade to a more recent release.

Go to the [documentation for the latest StackState release](https://docs.stackstate.com/develop/developer-guides/stackpack/how_to_pack_and_upload_stackpack).
{% endhint %}

The `.sts` file is a zip archive that contains the [StackPack file structure](prepare_package.md). When all files are in place, archive your StackPack directory into a `.zip` file and change its extension to `.sts`.

To upload the `.sts` file to StackState use the [StackState CLI](../../../setup/installation/cli-install.md) with the following command: `sts stackpack upload path/to/file.sts`
