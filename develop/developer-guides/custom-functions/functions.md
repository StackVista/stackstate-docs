# StackState functions

## Overview

Functions in StackState are predefined scripts that transform input into an output. They are called by StackState on-demand. For example, when a component changes state, new telemetry flows in or a user triggers an action. Advanced users can develop their own functions to customize StackState. These functions can then be exported and [packaged with a custom StackPack](/develop/developer-guides/stackpack/develop_stackpacks.md).

## Function types

In StackState, different function types complete different tasks. Depending on the function type, it may be possible to specify [asynchronous or synchronous execution](#asynchronous-and-synchronous-execution) when creating a custom function. Some default functions are implemented as [native functions](#native-functions). 

| Function type | Synchronous execution | Asynchronous execution | Native functions |

## Asynchronous and synchronous execution

Functions in StackState run with either synchronous or asynchronous execution. For some functions it is possible to choose the execution type.

- **Asynchronous execution** - functions have access to all StackState [Script APIs](/develop/reference/scripting/README.md). Selecting asynchronous execution also makes it possible for more functions to run in parallel.
- **Synchronous execution** - functions do not have access to the StackState script APIs. If the function offers the possibility to be run with either asynchronous or synchronous execution, it is recommended to use asynchronous execution.

## Native functions

To improve performance, some default StackState functions have been implemented as native functions. It is not possible to view or edit the script body of a native function in the StackState UI. It is not possible to create a custom native function.
