# Tutorials

StackState is an open platform that can be extended to work with any other IT system in your landscape.

Choose from one of the available tutorials below to get started.

## Push-integration tutorial

The easiest way to connect an external system is by pushing data to StackState. This type of extension can be used to:

* send topology information from an external system to StackState
* send telemetry information from an external system to StackState
* set the state of a component in StackState based on information from an external system

This [push-integration tutorial](push_integration_tutorial.md) will show you how it works.

## Mirror tutorial

A mirror integration is a good fit if you want to retrieve telemetry data from an external system on-demand, while keeping the external system as the source of the data instead of StackState. A mirror can:

* retrieve telemetry data from external systems on-demand
* aggregate this data in various ways
* send the data in a standard format to StackState where it can be mapped to a component

This [mirror integration tutorial](mirror_tutorial.md) will show you how it works.
