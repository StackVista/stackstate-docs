{% hint style="warning" %}
**This page describes StackState version 4.0.**

The StackState 4.0 version range is End of Life \(EOL\) and **no longer supported**. We encourage customers still running the 4.0 version range to upgrade to a more recent release.

Go to the [documentation for the latest StackState release](https://docs.stackstate.com/).

StackState is an open platform that can be extended to work with any other IT system in your landscape.

Choose from one of the available tutorials below to get started.

## Push-integration tutorial

The easiest way to connect an external system is by pushing data to StackState. This type of extension can be used to:

* send topology information from an external system to StackState
* send telemetry information from an external system to StackState
* set the state of a component in StackState based on information from an external system

This [push-integration tutorial](push_integration_tutorial.md) will show you how it works.

## Mirror tutorial

A mirror integration is a good fit if you want to retrieve telemetry data from an external system on-demand, while keeping the external system as the source of the data instead of StackState. A mirror can:

* retrieve telemetry data from external systems on-demand
* aggregate this data in various ways
* send the data in a standard format to StackState where it can be mapped to a component

This [mirror integration tutorial](mirror_tutorial.md) will show you how it works.
