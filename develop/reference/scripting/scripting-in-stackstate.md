# Scripting in Rancher Observability

Rancher Observability uses scripting in many places to:

* Transform incoming data
* Query 4T data
* Describe state changes of the 4T data model 
* Control the Rancher Observability UI
* Create reports
* Connect to external services

Rancher Observability scripts are written using the Rancher Observability Scripting Language \(STSL\), which is based on [Groovy](https://groovy-lang.org/). The choice of Groovy is motivated by the fact that Rancher Observability is written in Scala and runs on JVM. Currently, Groovy is the best and most performant script language for JVM. You aren't stuck to using Groovy though, you can use the [HTTP script API](script-apis/http.md) to develop logic in any language.

All scripts have a default \(configurable\) timeout of 15 seconds.

## Running Scripts

Rancher Observability scripts can be executed in the [Analytics environment](../../../use/stackstate-ui/analytics.md). This can be accessed from the main menu of the Rancher Observability UI. The Analytics Environment interface consists of a scripting panel on the left and the results panel on the right.

Write a script in the **Query** panel and click **EXECUTE** to run it. The script output is displayed in the **Result** panel. Results can be viewed as a raw JSON string or as a preview generated by Rancher Observability automatically depending on the JSON object's type and content.

## Script APIs

All Rancher Observability functionality exposed via scripting is available via so-called script APIs. These are singleton objects starting with a capital case letter that contain a number of callable functions. Commonly used script APIs are:

* [Topology script API](script-apis/topology.md) for querying the topology 
* [HTTP script API](script-apis/http.md) for calling out to external services
* [View script API](script-apis/view.md) to get view definitions.

  Please have a look at the full list of [script APIs](script-apis/).

## Asynchronous and streaming programming

Most functions available through the Rancher Observability script APIs need some time to return a result. For efficiency reasons, Rancher Observability will suspend script execution while waiting for a result and continue other work on other background threads. When a function has an async return value, the word `async` is written before the return type in the script API documentation. This has implications for how to work with results. Please [read about async script results](async-script-result.md) to understand how this works. On top of asynchronous programming, some APIs make use of [streaming](streaming-script-result.md) to allow constant-memory processing of large amounts of data.
